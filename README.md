# liberandum

liberandum is a system designed to get funds into the hands of people in at risk populations in need of evacuation
before natural disasters with an eye toward mid-term help until their insurance checks come in in the event that
they experience property damage. Basically evacuating is expensive ($2k avg for family of four). We are trying to
help people who can't afford it evacuate anyway.

## The Stackâ„¢

This is a serverless app with much of it written in js. It runs a lambdas behind a web api gateway and uses 
neptune (or tinkerpop locally) for most of its data storage.
